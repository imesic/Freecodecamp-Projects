            <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. 
                It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. 
                Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application 
                development in many areas on most platforms.
                Python is a popular programming language. It was created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. <br>
                It is used for:

            <p>The Python language has many similarities to Perl, C, and Java.
                However, there are some definite differences between the languages.
            </p>
            <h4>Python Identifiers</h4>
            <p>
                A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. 
                An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).
                Python does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. 
                Python is a case sensitive programming language. 
                Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in Python.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are naming conventions for Python identifiers:
                <br>- Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.                    
                <br>- Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.
                <br>- Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.   
                <br>- If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.
            </p>
            <h4>Reserved Words</h4>
            <p>
                The following list shows the Python keywords. 
                These are reserved words and you cannot use them as constant or variable or any other identifier names. 
                All the Python keywords contain lowercase letters only.
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>and</td>

                    <td>import</td> 
                    <td>try</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>elif</td>
                    <td>in</td>

                <tr>
                    <td>except</td>
                    <td>lambda</td> 
                    <td>yield</td>
                </tr>
                </table>
                <h4>Multi-Line Statements</h4>
                <p>Statements in Python typically end with a new line. 
                    Python does, however, allow the use of the line continuation character (\) to denote that the line should continue. 
                    For example −
                </p>
                <code>
                    total = item_one + \
                        item_two + \
                        item_three
                </code>
                <p>
                    Statements contained within the [], {}, or () 
                    brackets do not need to use the line continuation character. For example −
                </p>
                <code>
                    days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday',
                    'Thursday', 'Friday']
                </code>
                <h4>Quotation in Python</h4>
                <p>
                    Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denote string literals, 
                    as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.<br><br>
                    The triple quotes are used to span the string across multiple lines. 
                    For example, all the following are legal − 
                </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Types">
            <header>Variable Types</header>
            <article>
                <p>Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. 
                    This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.<br><br>
                    Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. 
                    Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, 
                    decimals or characters in these variables.
                </p>
                <h4>Assigning Values to Variables</h4>
                <p>Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. 
                    The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. 
                    The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.<br><br>

                    The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = 
                    operator is the value stored in the variable. For example −
                </p>
                <code>
                    #!/usr/bin/python

                    counter = 100          # An integer assignment
                    miles   = 1000.0       # A floating point
                    name    = "John"       # A string
                        
                    print counter
                    print miles
                    print name
                </code>
                <h4>Standard Data Types</h4>
                <p>The data stored in memory can be of many types. For example, 
                   a person's age is stored as a numeric value and his or her address is stored as alphanumeric characters. 
                   Python has various standard data types that are used to define the operations possible on them and the storage method for each of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Python has five standard data types − 
                </p>
                <li>Numbers</li>
                <li>String</li>
                <li>List</li>
                <li>Tuple</li>
                <li>Dictionary</li>
                <h4>Python Numbers</h4>
                <p>Number data types store numeric values.
                   Number objects are created when you assign a value to them.<br><br>
                   Python supports four different numerical types −
                   <li>int (signed integers)</li>
                   <li>long (long integers, they can also be represented in octal and hexadecimal)</li>
                   <li>float (floating point real values)</li>
                   <li>complex (complex numbers)</li>
                </p>
                <h4>Python Strings</h4>
                <p>Strings in Python are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks.
                    Python allows for either pairs of single or double quotes. Subsets of strings can be taken using the slice operator ([ ] and [:] )
                    with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the string and working their way from -1 at the end.
                <br><br>
                The plus (+) sign is the string concatenation operator and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator. For example −
                </p>
                <code>
                    str = 'Hello World!'

                    print str          # Prints complete string
                    print str[0]       # Prints first character of the string
                    print str[2:5]     # Prints characters starting from 3rd to 5th
                    print str[2:]      # Prints string starting from 3rd character
                    print str * 2      # Prints string two times
                    print str + "TEST" # Prints concatenated string
                </code>
                <h4>Python Lists</h4>
                <p>Lists are the most versatile of Python's compound data types. 
                    A list contains items separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]). 
                    To some extent, lists are similar to arrays in C. One difference between them is that all the items belonging to a list can be of different data type.
                </p>
                <p>The values stored in a list can be accessed using the slice operator 
                    ([ ] and [:]) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the list and working their way to end -1. 
                    The plus (+) sign is the list concatenation operator, and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator.
                </p>
                <h4>Python Tuples</h4>
                <p>A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. 
                    A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas. 
                    Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within parentheses.

            <header>Python Functions</header>
            <article>
                <p>A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. 
                    Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. but you can also create your own functions. 
                    These functions are called user-defined functions.
                </p>
                <h4>Defining a Function</h4>
                <p>You can define functions to provide the required functionality. 
                    Here are simple rules to define a function in Python.
                </p>
                <li>Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).</li>
                <li>Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.</li>
                <li>The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the function or docstring.</li>
                <li>The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.</li>
                <li>The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. 
                    A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.</li>
                <h4>Syntax</h4>
                <code>def functionname( parameters ):
                        "function_docstring"
                        function_suite
                        return [expression]
                </code>
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <p>
                    The following function takes a string as input parameter and prints it on standard screen.
                </p>
                <code>def printme( str ):
                        "This prints a passed string into this function"
                        print str
                        return
                </code>

            <header>Classes and Objects</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes.
                    Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A very basic class would look something like this:
                </p>
                <code>
                    class MyClass:
                    variable = "blah"
                    
                    def function(self):
                        print("This is a message inside the class.")
